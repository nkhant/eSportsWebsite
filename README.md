# eSportsWebsite

Summary:
The goal of this project is to centralize eSports news into one website, featuring articles/highlights of recent events and tournaments. Content includes but is not limited to player interviews, recaps, and general eSports news. Emphasis is placed on the following major games: League of Legends, StarCraft, Smash and Street Fighter. 

Some of the features we aim to achieve are user login with separate accounts for reporters and the average viewer. A custom profile tailored specifically to their game tastes for which relevant news articles and highlights will be shown to them.

Site Tour:
The home page should consist of a short collection of eSports news from all 5 games mentioned above in the summary. From the home page, users can click on links to find more news about any particular game. 

Minimum Delivery:
At minimum for our website we expect to achieve a working database, navigation bar, two different user logins and a way for users to access the articles and videos. The users will also be able to use a search function to find specific articles or videos. Users who are logged in will be able to favorite articles and videos and save it to their dashboard.

Optional Features:
If time permits, weâ€™d like to implement a feature that will allow us to pull news content from other eSports news outlets, such as Dot Esports, ESPN eSports, and ESL gaming. Additionally, users will be able to save articles to their dashboard as well as receive notifications for when new content is released. 

Description of Roles and Tasks:
Because this website has several components, we decided to divide the work into front-end and back-end. We will have two people working on designing the website layout, and two people working on the website features.
